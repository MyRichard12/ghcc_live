His shop was a modest little place filled with the quiet ticking of countless timepieces. Children often pressed their noses against his window to watch the dancing gears and swinging pendulums, but few ever stepped inside. Rumor had it that Elias could make clocks that didn’t just tell time—they could remember it.\n\nOne stormy evening, a young woman named Clara appeared at his door with a broken pocket watch. It had belonged to her grandfather, a man she barely remembered but missed dearly. Elias took the watch gently, examined it, and nodded. \"This one still holds his time,\" he said with a faint smile. Clara didn’t understand, but something in his tone made her believe."},{"frontmatter":{"category":"Events Calendar","date":"2025-05-14T18:27:38.702Z","description":null,"externalLink":null,"featuredImage":"/md_images/grocery-1232944.jpg","location":"6:00pm, 4 Ogun River, Magodo, Ogun State","query":"Events","title":"Discipleship Class"},"body":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.
