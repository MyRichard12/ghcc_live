Althia Bryden, a 58-year-old British grandmother, experienced a bewildering transformation following her recovery from a stroke in May 2024. Despite never having visited Italy or studied the language, Bryden began speaking with a pronounced Italian accent, leaving her and her family astonished.[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/us-news/grandma-wakes-up-with-an-italian-accent-after-recovering-from-stroke-despite-not-knowing-the-language-i-feel-like-someone-is-impersonating-me/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Medical professionals suspect that Bryden is exhibiting symptoms of **Foreign Accent Syndrome (FAS)**, a rare neurological condition often associated with brain injuries or strokes. FAS causes individuals to speak in a foreign accent unintentionally, without having acquired it through cultural or linguistic exposure.

Before the stroke, Bryden had no history of speech disorders and led a typical life in the UK. Post-stroke, she faced temporary speech loss and right-side mobility issues. Upon regaining her speech, the unexpected Italian accent emerged. While her family found the change amusing, Bryden expressed feelings of disconnection, stating, "I feel like someone is impersonating me."[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/us-news/grandma-wakes-up-with-an-italian-accent-after-recovering-from-stroke-despite-not-knowing-the-language-i-feel-like-someone-is-impersonating-me/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Despite the emotional challenges, Bryden remains grateful for her recovery and is working with speech therapists to understand and potentially mitigate the accent change. Her case adds to the limited but intriguing instances of FAS documented worldwide.
